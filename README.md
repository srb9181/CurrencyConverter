# CurrencyConverter
This is Basic sample of Currency converter app.

For currunecy conversion I am using https://currencylayer.com/documentation API's. Create your account and get your api key.

Put your api key in local.properties file in Android studio as follows.

api.key="your_api_key"

Configure your api time offset from <strong>com.srb9181.currencyconverter.util.Constant</strong> file according to your requirement :

const val API_CALL_OFFSET = 1 * 30 * 60 * 1000
